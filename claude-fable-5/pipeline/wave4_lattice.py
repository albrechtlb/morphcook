"""Wave-4 lattice pipeline — codex writes, codex reviews, loop until it passes.

Rebuilds every dish around the actual USP: one dish, a complete lattice of
fully-authored recipes (diet × effort × calorie), per docs/corpus-brief-4.md.

For each dish:
  1. PLAN    codex drafts the dish plan (columns, pairs, cells, legacy map,
             coverage) → mechanical validation (validate_corpus.py) → a second
             codex reviews → on rejection the feedback loops back to the
             writer until it passes.
  2. CELLS   one recipe per lattice cell, written by codex, mechanically
             validated, then reviewed by a second codex — same feedback loop.
             Sequential within a dish so each author sees accepted siblings.
  3. DISH    cells merged, dish-level validation (lattice completeness,
             title uniqueness, soul-rule coverage), then one codex reviews
             the whole set and may bounce individual cells back to step 2.
  4. MERGE   when EVERY dish passes: recipes are written back into the app
             asset partitions, dishes.json is relinked, the partition
             manifest gets corpus_wave=4 (arming the app-side contract
             tests) and a version bump.

Everything is resumable — state is plain files under pipeline/wave4/; rerun
the same command and it picks up where it stopped. To redo one dish:
  ./wave4_lattice.py --reset-dish <id>   (then rerun)

Beyond the base lattice:

  GROW       --new-dish "okonomiyaki": codex researches the baseline
             (canonical spelling EN/DE, hero/caption, routing, missing
             catalog ingredients with allergen flags — reviewed, the flag
             audit is the safety gate), then the dish's full lattice is
             generated and merged. --suggest-dish N: codex invents N dishes
             itself (baseline only, queued; the next run writes their
             recipes — a queued dish never ships without its lattice).
  COVER      --expand-coverage: for every lattice cell, fully-authored
             variants for what people can't eat — free of gluten, dairy,
             nuts, … then pairs ("no gluten AND no dairy"), then triples.
             Cells already fine (a vegan cell is already dairy-free) are
             skipped; genuinely impossible ones are recorded and never
             retried. The longer it runs, the deeper the combination space.
  FOREVER    --forever: cycle = finish lattices → merge → one coverage
             combination → scout one new dish → repeat, until interrupted
             or --call-budget runs out. Fully resumable at any point.

Typical runs:
  ./wave4_lattice.py                      # the whole corpus, 4 dishes in parallel
  ./wave4_lattice.py --jobs 8             # more parallel dishes
  ./wave4_lattice.py --dishes doener,burger
  ./wave4_lattice.py --new-dish "pad see ew"
  ./wave4_lattice.py --suggest-dish 3    # queue three codex-invented dishes
  ./wave4_lattice.py --expand-coverage --max-combo-size 2
  ./wave4_lattice.py --forever --jobs 8  # let it run; ctrl-c is safe
  ./wave4_lattice.py --status            # progress overview, no codex calls
  ./wave4_lattice.py --merge-only        # just the merge (all dishes done)
  ./wave4_lattice.py --self-test         # machinery checks, no codex calls

Codex runs with `--sandbox read-only` (it never writes; this script owns all
file writes) and `--ephemeral`. Model defaults to your codex config; override
with --model / --review-model.
